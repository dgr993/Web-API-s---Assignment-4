# Web-API-s---Assignment-4

For this assignment i had to create a multiple choice quiz that had a timer and a way to post high scores. Javascript was a challenge as my mind was more familiar with css and html having learned it in highschool but i benefited greatly from using my network of resources to get the job done. As i learned and reached out and studied i was able to complete the assignment. I am proud mostly of the ability to concatenate all the opinions into one coherent project that turns out what is asked.
